# Day 1: Introduction to DevOps ðŸš€

## Daily Log

**Date:** June 12, 2024

Today, I kickstarted my 90 Days of DevOps journey by watching an insightful video on YouTube: [What is DevOps? REALLY understand it | DevOps vs SRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yWAtQ6wYNM). This video provided a comprehensive introduction to DevOps, the tools involved, the importance of DevOps, and various practices associated with it.

### Key Learnings:

- **What is DevOps?**
- **Why is DevOps needed?**
- **Essential DevOps tools**
- **DevOps practices**
- **Difference between SRE and DevOps**

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary to Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.

### Key Components of DevOps:

- **Collaboration:** Bridging the gap between development and operations teams.
- **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks to speed up processes.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Regularly integrating code changes and deploying them to production.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Keeping track of application performance and logs to ensure everything runs smoothly.

## What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?

### Automation:

Automation in DevOps involves using tools and scripts to automate repetitive and manual tasks. This includes automating builds, tests, deployments, and configuration management. Automation reduces the chances of human error and speeds up the development process.

### Scaling:

Scaling refers to the ability to handle increasing loads by adding resources. DevOps practices ensure that applications can scale efficiently to meet demand, whether through vertical scaling (adding more power to existing machines) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).

### Infrastructure:

Infrastructure in the context of DevOps includes the servers, storage, and networking components required to run applications. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key DevOps practice where infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and automation tools.

## Why DevOps is Important?

DevOps is crucial for several reasons:

- **Speed:** Faster delivery of features and updates.
- **Reliability:** Improved quality and reliability of software releases.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently scale applications to meet user demands.
- **Collaboration:** Enhanced collaboration between development and operations teams.
- **Security:** Integrating security practices throughout the development and deployment process (DevSecOps).

## DevOps Practices

### Continuous Integration (CI):

CI is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. This helps in detecting integration bugs early and improving software quality.

### Continuous Deployment (CD):

CD extends CI by automatically deploying all code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage. This ensures that the software is always in a deployable state.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

IaC involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts, rather than through manual processes. Tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Puppet are commonly used for IaC.

### Monitoring and Logging:

Monitoring involves tracking the performance of applications and infrastructure, while logging involves keeping a record of application events. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) are used for monitoring and logging.

## Difference Between SRE and DevOps

### Site Reliability Engineering (SRE):

SRE is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. The main goal of SRE is to create scalable and highly reliable software systems. SRE focuses on site reliability, ensuring that services are up and running smoothly.

### DevOps:

DevOps, on the other hand, is a broader culture and set of practices that aim to unify software development and operations. While SRE focuses more on reliability and uptime, DevOps emphasizes collaboration, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.
