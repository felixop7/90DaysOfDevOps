# Day 3: Basic Linux Commands 🐧

## Daily Log

**Date:** June 15, 2024

Today, I continued my 90 Days of DevOps journey by further exploring basic Linux commands. I worked through a task list, practicing different commands and learning new ones along the way.

## Task: What is the Linux command to

1. **View what's written in a file.**
   cat filename.txt

2. **Change the access permissions of files.**
   chmod permissions filename

3. **Check which commands you have run till now.**
   history

4. **Remove a directory/ Folder.**
   rmdir directoryname

5. **Create a fruits.txt file and to view the content.**
   touch fruits.txt
   cat fruits.txt

6. **Add content in fruits.txt (One in each line) - Apple, Mango, Banana, Cherry, Kiwi, Orange, Guava.**
   echo -e "Apple\nMango\nBanana\nCherry\nKiwi\nOrange\nGuava" > fruits.txt

7. **Show only top three fruits from the file.**
   head -3 fruits.txt

8. **Show only bottom three fruits from the file.**
   tail -3 fruits.txt

9. **Create another file Colors.txt and to view the content.**
   touch Colors.txt
   cat Colors.txt

10. **Add content in Colors.txt (One in each line) - Red, Pink, White, Black, Blue, Orange, Purple, Grey.**
    echo -e "Red\nPink\nWhite\nBlack\nBlue\nOrange\nPurple\nGrey" > Colors.txt

11. **Find the difference between fruits.txt and Colors.txt file.**
    diff fruits.txt Colors.txt

I am excited to continue this journey and delve deeper into Linux commands and their applications in DevOps. Stay tuned for more updates!

Happy Learning! 🚀
