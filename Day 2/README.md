# Day 2: Basic Linux Commands üêß

## Daily Log

**Date:** June 13, 2024

Today, I continued my 90 Days of DevOps journey by watching an informative video on YouTube: [Linux Commands for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39oyFIStuaI). This video provided a comprehensive introduction to basic Linux commands, which are essential for any DevOps professional.

### Key Learnings:
- **Basic Linux Commands**
- **Creating and managing files and directories**
- **Navigating the file system**
- **Practical examples of using Linux commands**

## Basic Linux Commands

Here are some of the basic Linux commands I learned today:

1. **whoami** - Displays the username of the current user.
whoami

2. **touch file_name.txt** - Creates a new file.
touch file_name.txt

3. **pwd** - Prints the current working directory.
pwd

4. **mkdir foldername** - Creates a new directory (folder).
mkdir foldername

5. **ls** - Lists the contents of the current directory.
ls

6. **cd dirname** - Changes the current directory to `dirname`.
cd dirname

7. **cd ..** - Moves one directory back.
cd ..

8. **mv src_path destination_path** - Moves or renames a file or directory.
mv src_path destination_path

9. **cat filename** - Displays the contents of a file.
cat filename

10. **clear** - Clears the terminal screen.
 clear

11. **echo "your text"** - Prints text to the terminal.
 echo "your text"

12. **ls -la** - Lists the contents of the directory with detailed information.
 ls -la

13. **nano file_name** - Opens the nano text editor to write to a file.
 - To exit nano: `Ctrl + X`, then press `Y` to save or `N` to discard changes, and press `Enter`.
 nano file_name

14. **history** - Displays all previously executed commands.
 history

15. **rm filename** - Deletes a file (be careful before deleting).
 rm filename

## Practical Examples

### Check Your Present Working Directory
pwd

### List All Files or Directories Including Hidden Files
ls -la

### Create a Nested Directory A/B/C/D/E
mkdir -p A/B/C/D/E

### Other Commands Tested
- **Create a new folder:**
mkdir newFolder

- **Create a hidden directory:**
mkdir .NewFolder

- **Create multiple directories at the same time:**
mkdir A B C D

- **Create a new folder in a specific location:**
mkdir /home/user/Mydirectory

- **Create a nested directory:**
mkdir -p A/B/C/D

I am excited to continue this journey and delve deeper into Linux commands and their applications in DevOps. Stay tuned for more updates!

Happy Learning! üöÄ
