- **Creating and managing files and directories**
- **Navigating the file system**
- **Practical examples of using Linux commands**

Here are some of the basic Linux commands I learned today:

1. **whoami** - Displays the username of the current user.
2. **touch file_name.txt** - Creates a new file.
3. **pwd** - Prints the current working directory.
   **mkdir foldername** - Creates a new directory (folder).
   **ls** - Lists the contents of the current directory.
   **cd dirname** - Changes the current directory to dirname.
   **cd ..** - Moves one directory back.
   **mv src_path destination_path** - Moves or renames a file or directory.
   **cat filename** - Displays the contents of a file.
   **clear** - Clears the terminal screen.
   **echo "print this"** - Prints text to the terminal.
   **ls -la** - Lists the contents of the directory with detailed information.
   **nano file_name** - Opens the nano text editor to write to a file.
   **To exit nano:** Ctrl + X, then press Y to save or N to discard changes, and press Enter.
   nano file_name
   **history** - Displays all previously executed commands.
   **rm filename** - Deletes a file (be careful before deleting).

   **mkdir newFolder**
   Create a hidden directory:
   **mkdir .NewFolder**
   Create multiple directories at the same time:
   **mkdir A B C D**
   Create a new folder in a specific location:
   **mkdir /home/user/Mydirectory**
   Create a nested directory:
   **mkdir -p A/B/C/D**
